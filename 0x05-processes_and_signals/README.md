## Process and PID Overview

### What is a PID?
- **PID** stands for Process IDentifier. It is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each process running in an operating system.

### What is a process?
- A **process** is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. It contains program code and its current activity, including its stack, heap, and data sections.

### How to find a process' PID?
- **ps**: Displays information about currently running processes, including their PIDs.
- **pgrep**: Searches for processes by their name and other attributes and lists their IDs.
- **pidof**: Returns the PID of a running program based on its name.
- **top**: Displays a dynamic real-time view of the running system, including processes and their PIDs.

### How to kill a process?
- Use the `kill` command followed by the PID of the process you want to terminate.
- Alternatively, use the `pkill` command followed by the name of the process you want to terminate.

### What is a signal?
- A **signal** is a software interrupt delivered to a process by the operating system. Signals are used to notify processes of significant events or to request that a process perform a particular action. They can be generated by the kernel, by another process, or by the process itself.

### Signals that cannot be ignored
- **SIGKILL (9)**: Immediately terminates the process.
- **SIGSTOP (19 or 20)**: Suspends the execution of the process until it receives a SIGCONT signal.

### Additional Commands:
- **exit**: Used to exit a shell or a script.
- **trap**: Allows a script to execute a command when it receives a signal. It can be used to catch signals and take appropriate actions in shell scripts.
