HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) serve several roles in ensuring secure communication over the internet:

1. **Authentication**: One of the main roles of SSL is to authenticate the identity of the server to the client (and sometimes vice versa). This ensures that the client is communicating with the intended server and not an impostor. Authentication is achieved through the use of digital certificates, which are issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and contain information about the identity of the website or server.

2. **Encryption**: SSL also encrypts the data transmitted between the client and the server, ensuring that it cannot be intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties. Encryption protects sensitive information such as login credentials, personal data, and financial transactions from being intercepted and read by attackers. This encryption is achieved using cryptographic algorithms that scramble the data in such a way that only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can access it.

The purpose of encrypting traffic is to provide confidentiality and integrity to the data being transmitted over the network. Encryption ensures that even if someone intercepts the data, they won't be able to understand its contents without the decryption key. This helps protect sensitive information and ensures the privacy of users.

SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting SSL-encrypted traffic at a proxy server or load balancer before forwarding it to the backend servers. When SSL termination is performed, the proxy or load balancer terminates the SSL connection from the client, decrypts the data, and then forwards it to the backend servers in an unencrypted format. This allows the backend servers to process the traffic without having to handle the overhead of SSL encryption and decryption. SSL termination is commonly used in scenarios where the backend servers don't need to directly handle SSL encryption, or when offloading SSL processing to a dedicated device or service can improve performance and scalability.
