# Networking Fundamentals README

## OSI Model
- **Definition:** The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework for understanding and standardizing communication systems.
- **Layers:** It comprises seven layers, each with specific functions building upon the layer below.
- **Organization:** 
  1. Physical
  2. Data Link
  3. Network
  4. Transport
  5. Session
  6. Presentation
  7. Application

## LAN (Local Area Network)
- **Definition:** LAN connects computers and devices within a limited area, facilitating resource sharing.
- **Usage:** Common in homes, offices, schools for local communication and resource sharing.
- **Geographical Size:** Typically covers a small area, from a single room to a few kilometers.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)
- **Definition:** WAN spans larger geographical areas, connecting multiple LANs and networks.
- **Usage:** Employed by organizations for connecting dispersed locations and facilitating long-distance communication.
- **Geographical Size:** Ranges from regional to global scales, spanning continents.

## Internet
- **Definition:** The global network of interconnected computers and devices.
  
## IP Address
- **Definition:** A numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network.
- **Types:** IPv4 and IPv6.

## Localhost
- **Definition:** Refers to the loopback address of a device, enabling communication with itself.

## Subnet
- **Definition:** A portion of a network divided for improved efficiency, security, and manageability.

## IPv6 Creation
- **Reason:** Addressing the limitations of IPv4, primarily address exhaustion.

## TCP/UDP
- **Protocols:** Both are transfer protocols.
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Reliable, connection-oriented.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Unreliable, connectionless.

## Port
- **Definition:** Logical construct identifying processes/services on a computer.
  
## Port Numbers
- - SSH: 22
  - HTTP: 80
  - HTTPS: 443

## Network Connectivity Check
- **Protocol/Tool:** ICMP echo request/reply (commonly known as "ping").
